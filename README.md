# AUSA - Adaptive Universal Simulation Agent

## Introduction

AUSA (Adaptive Universal Simulation Agent) is a pioneering project that explores the adaptability of AI-powered humanoids in extraterrestrial environments. The project utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to train a humanoid model that can predict its performance capabilities and respond effectively to various planetary conditions.

## Project Overview

The core of AUSA involves simulating and analyzing how AI-humanoid robots can rapidly adapt to diverse and challenging environmental circumstances, particularly in space. By integrating essential Earth environmental data, the model is designed to transition from terrestrial to extraterrestrial conditions gradually, focusing on critical factors like temperature, radiation, and atmospheric composition.

## Features

- **Environmental Adaptability**: The AI-humanoid model is trained to adapt to varying environmental conditions, including temperature fluctuations, radiation levels, and atmospheric changes.
- **Human-Like Characteristics**: The humanoid's physical, behavioral, and cognitive characteristics are modeled using advanced algorithms to ensure realistic interactions in simulated environments.
- **Multi-Model Approach**: Various neural network models, including LSTM, GRU, RNN, and CNN, are employed to optimize the humanoid's adaptability and performance in extraterrestrial settings.

## Models Used

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**
- **RCNN (Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network)**
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**

## Data Set

The dataset used in AUSA is derived from both imaginary and real-world parameters, tailored to simulate extraterrestrial conditions. Key parameters include:

- **Initial Parameters**:
